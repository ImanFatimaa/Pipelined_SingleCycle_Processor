# Pipelined_SingleCycle_Processor
# Introduction:  
A pipelined single cycle processor with hazards represents an advanced CPU architecture that combines the simplicity of single cycle execution with the performance enhancements of pipelining. In this architecture, multiple instruction stages overlap, allowing different parts of multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously. Typically, these stages include instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back. This overlapping significantly improves throughput and overall performance compared to a traditional single cycle processor where only one instruction is processed at a time. However, the introduction of pipelining also brings about potential hazards that can disrupt the smooth execution of instructions. These hazards fall into these main categories: data hazards, control hazards. Data Hazards occur when instructions that are close together in the pipeline need to access the same data. For example, if an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that has not yet completed, a data hazard arises. Techniques such as forwarding (also known as bypassing) and stalling are used to mitigate data hazards.
Control Hazards arise from the pipeline's need to make decisions based on the outcomes of previous instructions, particularly branches and jumps. These hazards can cause the pipeline to fetch incorrect instructions. Solutions to control hazards include branch prediction, delayed branching, and pipeline flushing.
To manage these hazards effectively, a pipelined single cycle processor incorporates several strategies, such as hazard detection units, forwarding paths. These mechanisms ensure that instructions are executed correctly without compromising the pipeline's efficiency. While pipelining adds complexity to the processor design, it significantly enhances the performance by enabling higher instruction throughput and better utilization of CPU resources.
# Objective: 

The objective of this project is to design and implement a pipelined single cycle processor capable of effectively managing various types of hazards to improve instruction throughput and overall performance. This involves developing a pipelined architecture that enables simultaneous processing of multiple instruction stages, thereby enhancing execution efficiency. A key focus is on addressing hazard mitigation by implementing techniques to detect and resolve data hazards, control hazards. This includes incorporating mechanisms such as forwarding, stalling, branch prediction. The project aims to optimize performance by minimizing the negative impact of these hazards through efficient hardware and control logic design. Additionally, thorough testing with diverse instruction sets and workloads will be conducted to validate the functionality and assess performance improvements over a non-pipelined single cycle processor. Ultimately, the project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of pipelined processor design, hazard management, and performance optimization strategies, serving as an educational tool for learning fundamental computer architecture concepts.
